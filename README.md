## Hi

These are some really good podcasts that I enjoy. I've recently started listening to podcasts while cooking and commuting so I thought I'd put up a list here. I use the <s>**Google Podcasts**</s> **Pocketcasts** app for listening to these, all of the podcasts are also available on it.

You can stay updated to new additions by clicking on the **Watch** button. Cheers, and do send PRs if you've good recommendations.
